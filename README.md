# Text Engine i made in one single file!! woohoo!!

This is just a random thing i made in like **8 hours**, and its just a text effect engine  

oh and also i made like 20 presets-

## Okay, cool, but how to i make my own things?
First, find the part wheres theres a bunch on stuff like this:

> // text
> 
>    text = text.replace(/**(.*?)**/g, '<span class="something">$1</span>');
