# 2 months of work
#### (at the moment)
this is the result of me spending a _little_ too much time from what is just a **project** of mine..

## Things included
- **[easy to use]**: Create text effects with just HTML and CSS.
- **a TON of premade stuff**: has **30+ built-in effects ᵃⁿᵈ ᶜᵒᵘⁿᵗᶦⁿᵍ**  and even some bonus ones!
- **exporting & importing**: save and share your stuff to the world!
- **customizable**
#### You can change some stuff _(only a few of them)_
