# Text Engine i made in one single file!! woohoo!!

This is just a random thing i made in like **8 hours**, and its just a text effect engine  

oh and also i made like 20 presets-

#### Okay, cool, but how to i make my own things? 
First, make a css style 

 .thing {  

   background-color: red;  

 }  

(you can use this if you dont know css well)

With the css done, find the part wheres theres a bunch of stuff like this:

> // text
> 
> text = text.replace(/##(.\*?)##/g,
'*<thing*="something">$1</thing>');

Copypaste that ⤴ under the last one (of the example i showed) and change:  
>> 1. things on the **(/##(.*?)##** section _(in this case, the **#'s**)_
>> to make the effect trigger itself (example: _**$**_ text _**$**_)

>> 2. **class=""** name on the ***<thing* class="something">** section to
>> the css class you made (in this example, **test**)

  now test your thing and it should work :)
